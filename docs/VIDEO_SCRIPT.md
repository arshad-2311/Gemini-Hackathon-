## BACKUP PLAN

If live demo fails during recording:

1. **Use Demo Mode**: The app has a built-in demo mode with pre-recorded sequences
2. **Screen record separately**: Record each feature individually, edit together
3. **Use mock data**: Frontend can run without backend using mock responses
4. **Explain with overlays**: If something breaks, explain what WOULD happen with text/graphics

---

## RECORDING TIPS

1. **Practice the script** at least 3 times before recording
2. **Warm up your voice** — speak clearly and at moderate pace
3. **Record in sections** — easier to fix mistakes
4. **Leave 2 seconds of silence** at start/end of each section
5. **Check audio levels** before long recording session
6. **Have water nearby** for dry throat
7. **Use Demo Mode for guaranteed smooth playback**
8. **Record at 1.5x window size**, scale down in editing for crisp text

---

## FINAL NOTES

The video should convey:
- **Innovation**: This is new, this is different
- **Impact**: This helps real people
- **Technical excellence**: Proper use of Gemini's capabilities
- **Polish**: Professional quality, attention to detail
- **Accessibility**: Captions, clear audio, readable text

**Remember**: Judges watch MANY videos. Make the first 15 seconds count!

Good luck! 🏆
